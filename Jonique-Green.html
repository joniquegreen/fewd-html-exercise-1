      <h1><strong>Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then & Now </strong></h1>
      <p><img src='images/htmlpic.jpeg' alt='Pixelated Image of Man with Beanie Hat on'/> IN <a href=http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/>"CONTENT Display Patterns"</a> (which all front-end fold should read),
          Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one Ethan Marcotte shared
          last month on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as standards..."</p>
        <p> Modular/atomic design doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom.
          Flexbox and grid layout don’t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better.
          HTML5 doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure
          from style came into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot change,
          because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium. </p>
